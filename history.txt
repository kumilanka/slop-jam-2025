- Planned Unity 6 top-down shooter architecture from Plan.txt brief.
- Scaffolded Assets folders and implemented core services (ServiceLocator, Startup, InputService fallback to legacy input, EventBus).
- Built player systems: HealthComponent, PlayerConfig/Runtime, PlayerController (now pure XY movement/rotation), Weapon pipeline with SO definitions and projectile handling converted to Rigidbody2D.
- Created enemy configs/brains/spawner plus DamageSystem/request flow.
- Added GameDirector orchestrator and UI Toolkit HUD/GameOver document (GameHUD.uxml/uss) with HUDDocumentView, wiring controllers to UI.
- Iterated on input/aim/shoot issues: legacy input support, direct movement, 2D aiming, projectile spawning warnings, Rigidbody2D collisions, corrected rotation to match mouse.
